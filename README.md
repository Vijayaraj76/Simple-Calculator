# Advanced Calculator 🧮

## **Description**
~ The Advanced Calculator is a versatile command-line tool designed to perform a variety of mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and square root calculations. 
~ It also includes a calculation history feature for reviewing previous computations.

---

## **Features**
~ Perform basic arithmetic operations:  
  ~ Addition (+)  
  ~ Subtraction (-)  
  ~ Multiplication (×)  
  ~ Division (÷)  
  ~ Power (^)  
  ~ Square root (√)
~ View calculation history (up to the last 10 calculations).
~ User-friendly menu interface with colorful prompts.
~ Handles errors like division by zero or invalid inputs gracefully.
~ Provides timestamps for all calculations.

## **How to Run**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd advanced-calculator
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

## **Technologies Used**
~ **Python**: Core programming language.
~ **Built-in Libraries**:
  ~ `math`: For advanced mathematical functions.
  ~ `os`: For clearing the console.
  ~ `time`: For creating animations.
  ~ `datetime`: For generating timestamps.

---

## **How It Works**
~ **Main Menu**: Displays all available operations and options.
~ **Input Validation**: Ensures user inputs are numbers and within acceptable ranges.
~ **Error Handling**: Manages invalid inputs, such as:
  ~ Division by zero.
  ~ Calculating square roots of negative numbers.
~ **History Tracking**: Stores recent calculations with timestamps.
